    <p>My name is Kehinde Omotoso, I am passionate about everything computers and tech, I started thinkering with electronics at a young age. I love
        the way a lot of things work together in a manner that it affects our lives directly, e.g, the Solar System.
        Although I am an enthusiast, I still believe in learning and discovering, because I know that no knowlwdge
        acquired is a waste. I love music, I love to cook, I love impressive architectures and good designs.
        I plan to get a degree in Software Development and hope to continue my education in that line.</p>
